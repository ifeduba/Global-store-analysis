  ##Analysis
1.	Top Countries by Profit
United States was the most profitable country, followed by India.
Profit in the U.S. was driven by high-end office equipment and technology products.

 2.Top Products by Profit
Products like Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier, Hewlett Packard printers, and Sauder furniture were leading profit contributors.
These items were especially impactful in the U.S. market.

3.	Shipping Cost Insights
Categories like Phones, Chairs, and Binders incurred the highest shipping costs.
These may require logistics optimization to improve overall margins.

4. Regional Profit Challenges
Southeast Asian countries (e.g., Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Vietnam) showed low or negative profit in key sub-categories.
Poor performance in categories like Tables and Bookcases signals a need for local market strategy adjustments.

5.Customer Profitability
High-value customers such as Raymond Buch were identified, purchasing premium products that drove significant profits.

6.   Technology has the highest  profit in Australia.
 
7. Nigeria does not appear among the top-performing countries in terms of total profit for 2014. 
Features Behind Nigeriaâ€™s Poor Performance:

a. Low Sales Volume
Nigeria may have had fewer transactions or limited customer engagement compared to markets like the United States or India.
Limited order frequency or basket size could reduce total revenue and thus, net profit.

b. High Shipping Costs
African markets often face high import duties, long delivery timelines, and poor logistics infrastructure.
This increases the cost-to-serve, especially for large or fragile items like furniture or technology.

c. Product-Region Mismatch
Sub-categories that perform well globally (e.g., Tables, Storage, or Bookcases) may not have strong demand or affordability in Nigeria.
Products might not align with local market needs or purchasing power.

d. Currency and Economic Factors
In 2014, Nigeria faced currency depreciation and oil price volatility which affected import costs and consumer purchasing power.
This might have led to reduced margins or returns after cost conversion.
